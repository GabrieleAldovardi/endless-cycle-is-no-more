# Achieveing Endless Cycle Backseated
### Run this code, leave your game overnight, get Reincarnation and Endless Cycle achievements

- Currently made for using it with ~~1920*1080~~ Any resolution :sunglasses: , it is now scalable ~~if you wish to change a few variables~~. Also does by default 1000 ascensions, you can change that variable.

- :exclamation: Remember to _**un-vault**_ any upgrades that might carry between ascensions and toggle the game _**Fullscreen : ON**_, otherwise it will stop from working properly.

Speed of the script may be improved (99% sure by a lot), but my laptop lagged so it might be slower than needed. Change 2 numbers and test your setup.
