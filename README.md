# Achieveing Endless Cycle Backseated
### Run this code, leave your game overnight, get Reincarnation and Endless Cycle achievements

- Currently made for using it on fullscreen with 1980*1080 resolution, it is scalable if you wish to change a few variables. Also does by default 1000 ascensions, you can change that variable too.

- Remember to _**un-vault**_ any upgrades that might carry between ascensions, otherwise it will stop from working properly.

Speed of the script can be improved, but my laptop lagged a bit so it might be slower than needed.
