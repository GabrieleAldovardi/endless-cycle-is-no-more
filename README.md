# Achieveing Endless Cycle Backseated
### Run this code, leave your game overnight, get Reincarnation and Endless Cycle achievements
> I chose to think about a bunch of code  
> Instead of clicking a bunch of times.  

-  UNDER CONSTRUCTION, MAY NOT WORK ATM ~~Currently made for using it with 1920*1080, if you wish to change a few variables.~~
- Does by default 1000 ascensions, you can change that variable.

~~- :exclamation: Remember to _**un-vault**_ any upgrades that might carry between ascensions and toggle the game _**Fullscreen : ON**_, otherwise it will stop from working properly.~~

\-> Speed of the script may be improved (99% sure by a lot), but my laptop lagged so it might be slower than needed. Change 2 numbers and test your setup.
